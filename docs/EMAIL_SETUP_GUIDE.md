# Email Configuration Guide for RPM Auto Website

## Overview

This document provides detailed information on setting up and troubleshooting email notifications for the RPM Auto website contact form. The website uses SendGrid to deliver email notifications when customers submit inquiries through the contact form.

## Current Configuration

The application is configured to:
- Store all inquiries in the database (regardless of email delivery status)
- Send email notifications via SendGrid to `fateh@rpmautosales.ca`
- Track the email delivery status in the database (`email-sent`, `email-failed`, or `email-error`)
- Log complete inquiry details if email delivery fails

## SendGrid Domain Verification Issue

The main issue we're encountering is with SendGrid's domain verification requirements. 

**Error Message:**
```
The from address does not match a verified Sender Identity. Mail cannot be sent until this error is resolved.
```

This happens because:

1. SendGrid requires sender email domains to be verified to maintain high deliverability rates
2. We're trying to send from an email domain that hasn't been verified in your SendGrid account
3. Microsoft 365 (which hosts your rpmautosales.ca email) has strict DMARC policies that reject emails that appear to be from your domain but are sent through unauthorized servers

## Solutions

### Option 1: Verify Your Domain in SendGrid (Recommended)

1. Log in to your SendGrid account
2. Go to Settings > Sender Authentication
3. Click "Authenticate Your Domain"
4. Follow the instructions to add DNS records to your domain
5. Once verified, update the `FROM_EMAIL` in `server/email.ts` to use your domain

This is the most professional and reliable solution that maintains your brand identity in emails.

### Option 2: Use a SendGrid Verified Sender

1. Log in to your SendGrid account
2. Go to Settings > Sender Authentication
3. Click "Create New Sender"
4. Verify a personal email address you control (e.g., Gmail)
5. Update the `FROM_EMAIL` in `server/email.ts` to use this verified email

### Option 3: Use Single Sender Verification

If you can't verify your domain, you can verify a single email address:

1. Log in to your SendGrid account
2. Go to Settings > Sender Authentication
3. Click "Verify a Single Sender"
4. Complete the verification process for your business email
5. Update the `FROM_EMAIL` in `server/email.ts` to use this verified email

## Backup Mechanism

In case of email delivery failures, we've implemented a robust backup system:

1. All inquiries are saved in the database, regardless of email notification status
2. The inquiry status is updated to reflect the email delivery outcome
3. Complete inquiry details are logged in the server console when email delivery fails
4. You can view all inquiries through the admin interface, even if email notifications failed

## Testing Email Configuration

After implementing any of the solutions above, test your email configuration:

1. Submit a test inquiry through the contact form
2. Check the server logs for email delivery status
3. Verify the inquiry appears in the database with the correct status
4. Confirm receipt of the email notification

## Support

If you continue to experience issues with email delivery:

1. Check your SendGrid API key and account status
2. Review SendGrid's sending limits and restrictions
3. Consult SendGrid's documentation: https://docs.sendgrid.com/
